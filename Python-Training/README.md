Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False
A boolean variable is a variable that is set to either True or False. "uppercase"

- true_value = True
- false_value = False

We can create boolean expressions using relational operators:

> ==: Equals

> !=: Not equals

> : Greater than

> =: Greater than or equal to

> <: Less than

> <=: Less than or equal to

### If / else / elif

- else statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.

- elif statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements
