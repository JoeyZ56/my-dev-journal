/*
You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.
Write a function to return the 3rd.

function otherAngle(a, b) {
  return 180 - a - b;

/*
    Approach:
        - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees
        - Subtract the two given angles from 180 to get the third angle
        - Return the third angle

/*
    what I learned:
        - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees
        - Subtraction
