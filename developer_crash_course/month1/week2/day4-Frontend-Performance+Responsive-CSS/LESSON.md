## ðŸ§  Todayâ€™s Focus:

React Performance Optimizations + Responsive CSS

    â€¢	React.memo, useMemo, and lazy/Suspense â€” learn when and why to use them
    â€¢	CSS Flexbox vs Grid â€” build muscle memory for layout decisions
    â€¢	Mobile-first design â€” breakpoints, scalable units, dev tools

Youâ€™ll walk away with a responsive layout that is performance-aware.

### âœ… Part 1: React Performance â€“ Core Concepts (30â€“40 min)

Take this as a knowledge warmup.

For each of the following:

    â€¢	Write down what you think it is (try before Googling)
    â€¢	Then look it up to clarify and update your notes
    â€¢	Ask questions freely â€” this part is meant to be confusing until itâ€™s not

Concepts to Define:

    1.	React.memo
    2.	useMemo
    3.	React.lazy
    4.	Suspense
    5.	Virtual DOM (why it matters for performance)
    6.	Hydration (especially for SSR in Next.js)

ðŸ“˜ Step 1: Key Concepts to Review Before Coding

Give these short definitions in your own words (no rush â€” look things up if needed): 1. Flexbox â€” What is it? When would you use it? 2. Grid â€” How is it different from Flexbox? 3. Mobile-first design â€” What does that mean? Why is it important?
