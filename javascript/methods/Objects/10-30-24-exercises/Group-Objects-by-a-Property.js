/*
Task:

Write a function that takes an array of objects and 
groups them by a specific property. 
Return an object where each key is a property value and the value is 
an array of objects with that key.

Hints:

	•	Use reduce() to iterate over the array and group the objects.
	•	Use the role property as the key in the output object.
