## Notes

### "htmlspecialchars" is a function in PHP that is used to convert special characters to their corresponding HTML entities. This is important to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), where malicious users can inject scripts into your web pages.

### "session_regenerate_id" is a function in PHP that is used to regenerate the session ID. It's often employed as a security measure to help prevent session fixation attacks. Session fixation is an attack where an attacker sets the session ID of a user, and if the user logs in with that fixed session ID, the attacker gains access to the user's session.

#### By periodically regenerating the session ID, even if the session is compromised, an attacker would need to continually guess or acquire the new session ID to maintain control over the session.
