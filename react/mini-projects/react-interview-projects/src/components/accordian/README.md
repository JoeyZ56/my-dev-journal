### State Initialization:

#### selected: Tracks the currently selected item's ID when in single selection mode. Initialized to null because no item is selected by default.

#### enableMultiSelection: A boolean that determines whether multiple items can be selected simultaneously. It is initialized to false, meaning the accordion starts in single selection mode.

#### selectMultiple: An array that holds the IDs of all selected items when in multi-selection mode. Starts as an empty array.

### Handlers for Selection:

#### handleSingleSelection(getCurrentId): This function toggles the selection state of an item based on its ID. If the clicked item is already selected (getCurrentId equals selected), it sets selected to null (deselects it). Otherwise, it sets selected to the clicked item's ID, selecting it.

#### handleMultiSelection(getCurrentId): Manages multiple selections. It first makes a copy of selectMultiple array, then checks if the clicked item's ID is already in the array. If it is not, it adds the ID; if it is, it removes the ID from the array.

### Logging for Debugging:

#### After either selection handler is called, it logs the state of selected and selectMultiple to the console, helping with debugging and state tracking.

### UI Rendering:

#### The component returns a div structure styled as an accordion:

#### A toggle button allows the user to switch between single and multi-selection modes.

#### If data exists, it maps over data and creates a div for each item with a clickable title. The onClick handler on the title div decides whether to call handleMultiSelection or handleSingleSelection based on enableMultiSelection state.

#### The accordion shows additional information (dataItem.info) for an item if it is currently selected, whether in single or multi-selection mode.

#### If there is no data, it displays a message indicating no data is available.
